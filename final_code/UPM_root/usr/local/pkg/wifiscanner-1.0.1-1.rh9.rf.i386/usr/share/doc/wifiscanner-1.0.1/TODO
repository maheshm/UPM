TODO:
- re-display spectral repartition. Now it's not display sometime, why ?
- Save the summary report and spectral analysis to a file
- use iwlist <interface> channel to define the channel list !
- When option -S is used, no data packet was dicovered !!! but if channel
  changed with + or - it detected data packet (critical bug)
  (I didn't see it for a long time, temporary closed)
- Check if MAC Add is not some spécific Mac add (Ipv6 broadcast, IGMP, ...)
- Write the size of the data bloc when a data packet is received
  ex : 06/02/2004 17:12:24.073,"",00(01),Wep,STA,...,Data To DS,DATA (xxx)
- Little proble with manufacturer identification ...
- Stats : count only channel read from packets (beacon, ...)
- When a DEAUTH is catched : Clear BSSID of the Deauthenticated Client
- Sometime the key pressed is lost and replaced by 'ÿ'
- try to compile in PPC architecture
- sort the node list on upper window
- Analyse REASSREQ and ASSOCIATION
- BUG: When REASSREQ arrive, paquet is not identified !
- Detect jammer (try to identify jammer with some sequence number and TimeStamp)
  it's begining to work
- Identify active scanner (netstumbler, dstumbler and Windows XP)
    Jammer and identify spoofed packet (two shot in one hole :)
- Do a dynamic allocation of catched data/packets
- In IDS : Analyse also when it's not a broadcast packet add a new array
    (Mac@ cli, SeqNum)
- Make a french version of Scanner (is it ireally needed :) ?)
- detect if wget is available (for oui base in makefile)
- Interface with Snort and/or Prelude (a big work)
- If Challenge and response are catched, do the XOR to get a keystream.
  (need to save a lot of data, and it already exist)
- Add option to save IV, Challenge, crypted challenge and Keystream
- if no name is given (for file) create an auto named file 
    WifiScanner.date.[tcp,dbg,txt,dot,ids,wep]
      .tcp : file contanning all network traffic - PCAP format (-W option)
      .dbg : All output (debug and normal output)
      .txt : Normal output (-F option)
      .dot : graphical architecture (-D option)
      .ids : All IDS alert - txt format with timestamp
      .wep : All weak DATA to crack WEP
      .kst : IV, Challenge, crypted challenge and Keystream - To do a Wep
             attack and clear text cryptographic attack
- Add TimeFirstSeen and TimeLastSeen in data structure
- If TODS=1 and FROMDS=1, There are 4 MAC Add, program expect always 3,
    so all data after are not correct (some work is done)
- Add a bpf filter as parameter
- Arrg so many options ... perharps I must think to do a parser of option
  file ...
- If scan on only one channel, do not write delta betwen detected channel and
  scanned channel
- Add capability to read and analyse data from pcap file.
- Change channel if CHANNEL_READ_COUNT is reach AND buffer is empty AND buffer
  is empty !
- Add capability to choose the channel range scan.
- Add capability to stop scan mode for a moment (like a pause) and do not
  buffer packets
- Add capability to ignore some MAC Address in interactive mode
- Change spectral repartition function to use means (of 16 value) and not
  max of value
- Do a GTK interface, is it really a good need ?
- send IDS alert to a file
- Write the summary with max of power

On the Way:
- Add more comment
- Add description of each functions
- Resolve equation y=ax+b and store a and b coef. This will used to detect ...
- Do multitread : One thread for changing channel, one another to analyse
  paquets, and a third to listen keyborad. First and third thread are OK.

DONE:
- Repair the function to make .dot file : some BSSID is 00:00:00:00:00:00. It
  seem to be not breaked :-)
- send IDS alert to syslog
- BUG: At the summary (end's summary) an ad-hoc client is identified as an AP
- Write in pannel windows if a card is STA/AP or AD-HOC not only STA/AP
- Use of -C cisco_wifi implie -i with TWO interface.
- Need to be more independant from linux-wlan-ng code.
  extract data from .h file and add them to src/wlan-ng.h
- Possibility of scroll in panel window
- scroll upper windows
- BUG: Repair -M option
- Add key interactivity  (+,-) working, more commands is okay
- create man page
- Use long-option for a better configuration
- Add a default display of unknow or un-analysed packet
  only CFEND, CFENDCFACK, CFACK, CFPOLL, CFACK_CFPOLL is not analysed
- Optimize src/wlan-ng.c function and look at airsnort/src/capture.c
  Call to driver is made directly with ioctl call
- Make a french version of README
- change name to wifiscanner
- BUG: When -H13 option is used, program exit directly ?!
- Add compatibility with HostAP and CISCO driver.
- Add Max speed available for each detected client in summary
- All specific function to WLAN-NG driver are in one file
- Indicate the gap between channel read in packet and channel scanned
- Re-Add the capability to define speed scan
- Make an abstration layer to interface with different cards
- BUG: Do not count INVLD paquets when -M option is activated
- configure.in is used more correctly
- BUG! : When 255 devices is detected, WifiScanner hang UP ! :-((
- Add in configure the option to define libpcap location
- Use more correctly the autoconfigure procedure
- Create and use a real function to write debug infos, do clean exit and write all 
  of those information to a debug file
- Count WEAK IV, Crypted packets, display last IV
- BUG? Sometime STA FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF is appear ?!
- Add an option to become actif (can send packet to be proactif) (obsolete)
- Create function to make some mgmt packets (canceled)
- Can send desassociate packet to a STA, to discover the SSID when is obfuscated
    (AirJack do it for me :)
- Detect AirJack, and forged mgmnt packet (can be id by diff of TimeStamp)
  (it wad detected but not identified)
- BUG: sometime time is hh:mm:ss.1000, do a little correction :-)
- BIG BUG: debug addditionnal information field !! - SegFault (it found in 
  LogPutOtherInformation function)
- Curses is better detected (option --with and --without work now)
- Iso-functionnality betwen curses version and non curses version
- BUG: when a card is turnning on, information are not correctly catch and updated
- DO refresh RealTime_WND only if sothink is writed and maximum one time per second
- BUG: Restrict to printable ASCII the SSID
- Make an ncurses interface or gtk
- Add an option to choice the max number of packet to read
- Analyse Probe Response (deduc channel of ad-hoc card)
- Do a better detection of type of client (problem with Probe request)
- Detect if Data packet is crypted (like airsnort)
- Create a function to collect information, analyse and do some correlation to
  give more information, like DS gateway, number of client, MAC @ of client in
  a network ...
- Do some cleanning in Wlan-NG integration (especially in .o)
- Detect if a prismII card is present
- Make some picture of detected network architecture (in .dot format of GraphViz)
