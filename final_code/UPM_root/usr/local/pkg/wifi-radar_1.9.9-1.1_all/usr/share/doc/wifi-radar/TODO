* Look into:
    why is the maximum length of a key only 32 symbols? it coudn't be hard
    to programm that 63 symbols long keys are accepted too, or is it?

*   Add a "No IP Config" button.  As in, only configure my wifi 
    settings, let my OS configure my IP settings.
* Add a column to display the channel the wireless network is using.
  Idea by: John Skovran
* True integration of WPA TKIP (wpa_supplicant)? (PARTIALLY done in
  0.3.8-6mdk) 
* An email list and a wiki.
* "Cancel" button on the "Acquiring..." dialog box.
* "About" button, with brief description and CREDITs.
* Make wifi-radar run as a perpetual daemon that always checks the
  connection status then Auto connects when possible.
* Add more ifconfig and iwconfig status info.
* Translate.
* Hover over help to say drag and drop profiles to set ordered
  preference.
* Check box to allow attempt to connect to unconfigured APs, if no
  configured APs exist, in daemon mode.
* Add a check box to automatically close the GUI on successful IP
  acquisition.  Wait X seconds before closing.
* dbus extension for wifi-radar to make normal users able to start it
  without having root or sudo.  Suggested by Patrick Winnertz.
* handle --daemon mode case of properly ending or killing existing
  instance of dhcp daemon prior to requesting new address.
